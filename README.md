# Data Analysis for Alberta University website
• This project implemented for "Fundamentals of Data Mining" course.
• The purpose of this project is to learn data gathering with a crawler, Data preprocessing, and Data Analysis in Python.

**This project conducted in several phases with different goals.**

First, we use a Crawler to extract the courses' properties of each department. The purpose of this phase is to familiarize with the methods of data collection from web pages and build a suitable dataset to perform data mining operations on it.</br>
The tools we used in this phase are Selenium and Soup Beautiful.
</br>
</br>
Second, we use preprocessing methods to clean our dataset. This phase aims learning how to clean the dataset, using preprocessing methods. 
</br>
</br>
At the last phase, we found out how to analyze our dataset to answer some statistics Questions like:</br>
- What is the ratio of the total course units of each department in this university to the total course units of other departments?</br>
**OR**</br>
- What is the average course units for each department in this university?

Then we use plots to show the answer of these questions. For example, for the first question, the circular plot created:

And for the second, the bar plot:
